Installation
Prerequisites:

Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. Download and install Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers. Steps to Create a Dynamic Web Project (Sports Academy) in Eclipse:

Open Eclipse: Launch the Eclipse IDE.

Create a New Dynamic Web Project:

Go to File -> New -> Dynamic Web Project. Enter "SportsAcademy" as the Project Name. Choose the Target Runtime. If not configured, click "New Runtime..." to set up a server runtime environment (e.g., Apache Tomcat). Specify the Dynamic Web Module version. You can leave other settings as default for now. Click Finish. Project Structure: Once created, the "SportsAcademy" project will appear in the Package Explorer. You'll see folders like Java Resources for Java code, WebContent for web resources (HTML, JSP, CSS, JavaScript, etc.), and other configuration files.

Adding Packages and Resources:

Right-click on src folder -> New -> Package. Create packages for different functionalities (e.g., controllers, models, utils, etc.). Add Servlets, Java classes, or other resources by right-clicking on respective folders (src for Java files, WebContent for web resources) and selecting New. Configuring web.xml:

Open web.xml located in WEB-INF directory. Set servlet mappings, filters, and other configurations required for your web application. Designing Web Pages:

Create HTML, JSP, CSS, and JavaScript files inside the WebContent folder to design the web pages for the Sports Academy website. You can organize these files into folders for better management (e.g., css, js, images). Deployment and Running:

Right-click on the project -> Run As -> Run on Server. Choose the server (e.g., Apache Tomcat) and click Finish. Eclipse will start the server and deploy your "SportsAcademy" web application. Testing: Open a web browser and access your application using the server's URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080/SportsAcademy).
